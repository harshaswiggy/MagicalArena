# Magical Arena Game

## Overview

This is a simple magical arena game where two players fight until one of them dies. Each player has three attributes: health, strength, and attack. Players attack in turns, rolling dice to determine the amount of damage inflicted and defended.

## Rules

1. Players attack in turns.
2. The player with the lower health attacks first at the start of the match.
3. The attacking player rolls a 6-sided die to determine the attack damage.
4. The defending player rolls a 6-sided die to determine the defense strength.
5. The difference between the attack damage and the defense strength reduces the defender's health.
6. The game ends when a player's health reaches zero.
